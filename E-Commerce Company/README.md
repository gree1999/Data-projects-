<h4>Project Description</h4>

This project marks a major milestone in my Business Analytics journey within the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program, showcasing my ability to apply the skills and knowledge gained throughout the program in a real-world setting. As an independent undertaking, it demonstrates my capacity to practically implement business analytics concepts and techniques, reinforcing my mastery of the subject matter.

<h3>Details</h3>

This comprehensive project is presented in an 8-page spreadsheet, featuring a structured layout with distinct sections for raw data (confidentially hidden), processed data, in-depth analysis, and interactive pivot tables. The main goal was to extract valuable insights from the company's raw transaction logs, converting complex event data into meaningful and actionable business metrics that inform strategic decision-making.

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

It is presumed that the 'raw_user_activity' sheet provides a comprehensive record of all website interactions during the specified period, with any potential gaps or inconsistencies in the data considered negligible and unlikely to impact analysis outcomes. Furthermore, the data is assumed to be accurately formatted, with consistent column headers and data types throughout, ensuring reliability and integrity for analytical purposes.

<h3>Process</h3>

The project began with a rigorous data discovery phase, encompassing data filtering, cleansing, and exploration. Next, I developed a detailed conversion funnel to monitor user engagement, followed by data preparation for cohort analysis to uncover enduring behavioral patterns. To assess customer loyalty and retention, I calculated retention rates, providing valuable insights into long-term engagement. Throughout the project, I prioritized meticulous formatting and documentation, ensuring seamless communication of findings and effortless interpretation for the client.
