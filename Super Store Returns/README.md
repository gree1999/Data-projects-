<h4>Project Overview</h4>

This project presents a detailed 9-page Tableau report, showcasing data insights, interactive dashboards, and visual storytelling. Its main goal is to equip the CEO of Superstore with a thorough understanding of the key drivers behind customer returns, and to recommend effective strategies to reduce the incidence of returned orders, informing data-driven decisions to enhance business performance.

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

The current sales data suggests that profits are trending downward, with losses likely stemming from one or more factors closely tied to order and return processes. To reverse this trend, the Operations department will need to identify and address the root causes of these losses, implementing targeted changes to optimize performance and restore profitability.

<h3>Procedure</h3>

The project followed a systematic approach, including the following steps:

Data consolidation: Sheets were joined to streamline data analysis. Data analysis using visualizations: Various visualizations were utilized to identify the root causes of returns. Dashboard creation: A dashboard was developed to facilitate ongoing monitoring and analysis of returns. Tableau story creation: A narrative-driven presentation was crafted using Tableau to effectively communicate the findings and recommendations.
