<h4>Projrct overview</h4>

This 7-page Tableau Visualization project presents a detailed analysis of a store's operations, featuring interactive charts and a comprehensive dashboard. Its main objective is to deliver expert consultancy to the company, identifying areas for improvement and recommending data-driven strategies to boost profitability and mitigate the risk of financial distress.

<h4>Assumptions</h4>

Current sales data indicates a loss in profits, suggesting that one or more factors related to orders and returns are driving this decline. To reverse this trend, the Operations department must identify and address the underlying causes, implementing corrective measures to improve performance. Additionally, targeted recommendations will be provided to the Advertising department to refine their strategies, ensuring optimal allocation of resources and enhanced return on investment.

<h4>Procedure</h4>

The data analysis process involved consolidating disparate sheets to facilitate a unified view, enabling the identification of key profit and loss centers through a thorough examination of various metrics. Furthermore, a detailed investigation was conducted to assess the impact of returns on overall profitability, uncovering insights into the specific areas of the business where returns are eroding profits.
