<h4>Customer Analysis Segmentation</h4>

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of Zomato's customer base through segmentation techniques. By leveraging demographic data obtained directly from Zomato's database, we aimed to identify distinct customer segments based on various factors such as age, gender, education level, income, and marital status. The insights generated from this analysis can inform targeted marketing strategies, product/service enhancements, and customer relationship management initiatives for Zomato.

<b>Problem Statement</b>

Lack of targeted marketing strategies tailored to specific customer segments.
Limited understanding of customer demographics and preferences.
Challenges in optimizing customer relationship management initiatives.

<b>Findings</b>

This analysis suggests that marketing and promotional efforts should be targeted 
primarily towards single individuals, particularly those who are students or 
employed, within the age group of 21-30, because for them itâ€™s a need to order food 
for their daily basis. So, we should make them loyal toward Zomato for not shifting 
to other apps.
Higher income groups (more than Rs. 50,000) also show a higher average sales 
amount, but the count of users is significantly lower compared to lower-income 
groups.
Weekday Peaks: Orders peak significantly on Thursday and Friday across all family 
sizes. This suggests that users, regardless of family size, are more likely to place 
orders towards the end of the workweek to get relaxed for the weekend or might be 
tired working the whole week.
The distribution of ratings highlights that users are generally satisfied but not 
overwhelmingly impressed, as evidenced by the lack of any restaurant achieving a 
5-star rating. 

<b>Aim</b>

Zomato, as a leading food delivery platform, faces the challenge of catering to a wide range of customer preferences and behaviors. By conducting this analysis, we aimed to provide Zomato with actionable insights to tailor its offerings and strategies effectively. Our goal was to assist Zomato in optimizing operations, enhancing customer satisfaction, and standing out in the competitive food delivery landscape.

<b>Summary</b>

Target Single Individuals: Focus on single-member families, especially those aged 
21-30, as they show higher average sales quantities. Mid-Week Promotions: Introduce special offers from Monday to Wednesday to balance order volumes throughout the week. Operational Efficiency: Align staffing with peak order times and use automated 
order reminders to enhance customer service and capture more sales.
