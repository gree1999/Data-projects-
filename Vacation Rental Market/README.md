<h4>project Overview</h4>

This comprehensive project culminates in a 17-page spreadsheet, featuring a structured layout with distinct sections for raw data (confidentially hidden), processed data, in-depth analysis, interactive pivot tables, and a visual bar chart. The primary objective is to identify the most viable property types for targeting in Manhattan's vacation rental market, leveraging insights from Airbnb data to inform strategic decisions and optimize market opportunities.

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

For the purpose of this analysis, it is presumed that Airbnb rental data serves as a reliable proxy for broader vacation rental market trends. Rental activity is gauged by the number of reviews received within the past 12 months, with properties lacking recent reviews considered inactive. To maintain data integrity, outliers have been excluded, including super luxury listings ($1,956.00+) and extremely low-priced listings ($82-), each accounting for 1% of the dataset. Furthermore, Superhost properties are used as a benchmark for pricing, as they are assumed to be representative of the target investment properties.

<h3>Methodology</h3>

The project involved a multi-step process, commencing with data exploration, filtering, and cleansing to guarantee data accuracy and integrity. Next, aggregations and pivot tables were created to pinpoint the most viable property types for targeting. To estimate occupancy rates and revenue, calculations, pivot tables, and charts were employed. Additionally, an optional analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of various property attributes on the vacation rental market. Finally, the data was meticulously formatted to enhance readability and ensure seamless communication of findings to the client.

<h3>Findings</h3>

Key findings reveal that the Lower East Side neighborhood boasts the highest number of reviews and is particularly popular for one-bedroom rentals. Occupancy rates peak on Fridays. Notably, Midtown properties with one bathroom generate the highest annual revenue, at $99,050. Interestingly, the presence of a doorman has no significant impact on review scores. Furthermore, analysis shows that hosts cannot command higher prices based on their rating, as ratings are evenly distributed. Superhosts also cannot charge more than regular hosts, as they have a higher proportion of non-superhost reviewers. Rating is not a primary factor in determining higher property prices. Additionally, the top 10 neighborhoods predominantly feature single-bedroom homes, followed by two-bedroom homes.
