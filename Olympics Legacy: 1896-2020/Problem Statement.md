<h3>Problem Statements:</h3>

How has female participation in the Olympics evolved over the last 124 years?<br>
Which countries have the highest number of female athletes winning medals, and how has this changed over time?
Which sports are the hardest to get a medal in. As in ratio of people who medaled vs the amount of people who didn’t. *We can see if there is correlation to L2. Like, if females tend to succeed in sports where there is “hard” to medal in, I think that would be a cool thing.
What is the percentage of female athletes participating in the top 10 countries with the highest number of total athletes in the Olympic games?
How has the percentage of female athletes participating in the Olympics changed over time for the 5 summer sports present since 1900?
How do the performances of female athletes compare to male athletes, and how has this trend changed from 1900 to 2020?

<h3>Conclusions:</h3>
The participation and performance of female athletes are growing and improving every day. This reflects a heightened global awareness of gender equality, with women’s rights gaining momentum worldwide. This progress could be attributed to the inclusion of more women’s events, changes in Olympic policies, and increased governmental and institutional support, among other factors.
